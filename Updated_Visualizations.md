##### Note: Last week's visuals (intitial visuals) had some issues with connecting the right data points to the correct counties. There would be issues when there were multiple counties with the same name, as the data would not correctly sort to the accurate county. Resolved this issue by updating Tableau data connections from County-County to County FIPS - County FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard Publication code), which was a unique identifier for each County.
