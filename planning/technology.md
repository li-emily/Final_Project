# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Python Jupyter Notebook will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis.  Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Amazon Webservices, Google Colabs, and Python to display the data.

## Machine Learning
We want to build a logistic regression model to determine which counties are at risk for low-vaccination. R will be utilized to build our model.

## Dashboard
We will be using Javascript and Python to create a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on HTML.
