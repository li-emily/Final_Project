# Measuring the Impact of the COVID Epidemic

## Overview:

  The aim of our analysis is to determine how demographic factors including location, age-range, sex, race, and ethncity, contribute to the likelihood of developing severe responses to COVID-19? The team chose this topic since the COVID pandemic has dominated life in the United States over the past two years. As vaccines and medications have been developed, we wanted to explore and see which communities in the United States were most at risk for negative outcomes. 

**Data source**: 

  We utilized sources provided by the CDC which examined: 
  * Demographics of Patients withg COVID-19 in 2021 
  * Population Vaccination Data in 2021
  * Hospitalization and Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 in 2021

**Communication**: Through Slack direct messages, weekly Zoom meetings. Share files through Google Drive.
