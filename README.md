# Measuring the Impact of the COVID Epidemic

## Overview:

## Purpose: 

The aim of our analysis is to determine how demographic factors including location, age-range, sex, race, and ethncity, contribute to the likelihood of developing severe responses to COVID-19? The team chose this topic since the COVID pandemic has dominated life in the United States over the past two years. As vaccines and medications have been developed, we wanted to explore and see which communities in the United States were most at risk for negative outcomes. 

**Source of Data**: 

 We utilized sources provided by the CDC website which examined: 
  * Demographics of Patients withg COVID-19 in 2021 
  * Population Vaccination Data in 2021
  * Hospitalization and Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 in 2021

**Challenges and Recommendations**

* Many of our datasets were difficult to clean and did not merge properly with other datasets. Next time, we would use datasets that were more clean to start with. 
* When it came to creating out dashboard, some of our files were too large to work with when building the html page. In the future, we would decrease the size of the file and pare down the data prior to building the html page.
* We had such a large breadth of data from the CDC, so it was hard to tell what was really relevant to our predictive model. In the future, we would try to have a clearer vision of what data is necessary.
