# Final_Project

COVID cases and vaccinations on a US county level lens.

Question: How can we predict possible future cases/vaccinations? Where does the US need to focus on?


Possible datasets:

* [covid cases by states](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36)
* [state by state covid vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/us-states-vaccinations)
* [county breakdown of covid cases](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/)
* [demographics data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographic)
* [county breakdown of personal income](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas)
* [religion census](https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/)
