Provisional Machine Learning Model Outline

•	Which model did you choose and why?

Logistic regression model was chosen because we want to predict possible future vaccinations and where the US needs to focus on. This logistic regression model will focus on analyzing the available data for COVID vaccinations in US counties. 

•	How are you training your model?

This model is trained using CSV datasets which include sociodemographic barriers, vaccinations administered, per capita income, vaccination data from every county and healthcare access barriers retrieved from governmental data sites. 

•	What is the model's accuracy?

It will predict COVID vaccine effectiveness in counties across the US. 
This model will predict the tendency of people getting vaccinated and those that are not based on different datasets, so that a system can be developed to know in what US counties vaccination rates are lowest. Tt will predict output with high accuracy for a large set of data.

•	How does this model work?

Based on the datasets, this model will predict the trend of people that are getting vaccinated. This prediction will be based on different CSV files including counties, demographics and different barriers. The model will be using data from the database in pgAdmin (SQL) called "COVID_Vaccination_Study".
