•	Which model did you choose and why?
Logistic regression model was chosen because we want to predict possible future vaccinations and where the US needs to focus on. This logistic regression model will focus on analyzing the available data for COVID vaccinations in US counties. 

•	How are you training your model?
Inputing datasets which include sociodemographic barriers, vaccinations administered, per capita income, vaccination data from every county and healthcare access barriers.
•	What is the model's accuracy?
It will predict COVID vaccine effectiveness in counties across the US. 
This model will predict the tendency of people getting vaccinated and those that are not based on different datasets, so that a system can be developed
to know in what US counties vaccination rates are lowest. 


•	How does this model work?
Based on the datasets, this model will
