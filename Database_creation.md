# Database Mock-Up Creation

In order to collect the information for our COVID-19 Vaccination study, we have decided to use SQL as our database host. 

Steps Taken To Create Database:
* Created new database on pgAdmin (SQL) 
* Created a table containing vaccination data from every county in the US, per capita income, number of vaccinations administered, sociodemographic barriers, and healthcare access barriers. This is a mock-up of the final data table we will complete. Note that this is an empty table for now which will be filled in once our data is cleaned. 
* Created a table containing per capita income information for each county in the US.
* Imported data into per capita income information for each county in the US. 

Next Steps:
* We will create tables and import csv information for each parameter of our study (e.g., number of vaccines administered, sociodemographic barriers, healthcare access barriers, etc.)
* We will merge data sets on common data points (e.g., county names) to obtain relevant information for the study.
